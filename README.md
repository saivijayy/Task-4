# DevOps Internship Task 4: Version-Controlled DevOps Project

## Objective
Build a version-controlled DevOps project using Git best practices. This task involves setting up Git branches (`main`, `dev`, `feature/initial-setup`), performing version control operations, and documenting the process.

## Tools Used
- Git
- GitHub

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saivijayy/Task4.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Task4

3. Checkout to your preferred branch (e.g., main, dev, feature/initial-setup):
   ```bash
   git checkout main

4. Pull the latest changes:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main

5. Follow any additional setup instructions specific to the project (e.g., setting up environments, dependencies).

## Branches and Workflow
main: The main production branch.

dev: The development branch where features are merged.

feature/initial-setup: A feature branch for the initial setup and configuration.

Use Pull Requests (PRs) to merge changes between these branches.

## How to Contribute
Fork the repository.

Create a feature branch from dev for your changes.

Open a pull request to merge your changes back into the dev branch.

## Links
GitHub Repository: https://github.com/saivijayy/Task4

## Version Tag
v1.0: Initial release of the project.
```
### How to Use This:
1. Copy the content above into a new `README.md` file.
2. Save the file in the root directory of your project.

This `README.md` includes:
- Project title and objective
- Setup instructions
- Git workflow (branches and merging)
- Contribution instructions
- A version tag reference

Once this is added, your project will be well-documented and ready for submission.
